# Steak

Let's enter the mud fight, with a few opinions!

Overall this is not much of a recipe, but the process I personally use; Some steps have reasoning behind then, others simply work for me.


## Instructions

* Get the steak **out of the fridge** about **30 to 60 minutes before** you intend to start **cooking**.
* Do NOT apply salt and pepper before searing off the steak![^1]
* **Cover the steak** in a thin layer of **oil** (rather than oiling the pan).[^2]
* You can also pre-heat an **oven to ~85°C**.
* Get a pan and get it nicely hot.[^3]
* **Quickly sear both sides** of the steak to get some color.
* **Finish** off in the **oven**.[^4]
* Once the steak is (almost) as done as you like it, get it out of the oven and let it **rest for 2-3 minutes**.
* Now you can **add some salt and pepper** (top side only).
* Get the pan nicely hot again.
* **Add** the **steak** with the non-peppered side down **to the pan**.
* **Add** some rosemary, thyme, roughly cut garlic and butter.
* **Baste** (/arroser) the steak.[^5]
* After letting the steak **rest** again for a short while, **cut** (/trancher) it into slices.
* Also make sure to save the flavoured butter from the basting step - that stuff is liquid gold!

When it comes to the sides, I tend to go with classics, rosemary potatoes or potato wedges and maybe some salad.


[^1]: The initial searing step is to get some color. For that we rely on the Maillard reaction, which requires at-least 170°C. If we would apply pepper before that step the pepper would burn. Salt on the other hand would draw out the moisture from the meat, creating a steam layer below the meat - thus lowering the temperature.


[^2]: Best way to make sure you use neither too much nor too little oil. Also make sure to use an oil that can take some heat, so rape seed rather than olive oil!


[^3]: Non-stick pans don't get hot enough (at-least not safely) so you certainly want to use some 'sticky pan' - personally I use stainless steel, but cast iron or carbon steel also work. Btw, we want it nicely hot (and give the metal of the pan a little bit of time to expand) to make sure that the steak won't stick.


[^4]: We want a core temperature of 58°C (for medium). Simple to check if you have a meat thermometer. If you don't have one you can try to 'poke-test'.


[^5]: Like the initial searing not too long. You just want to add some aroma and 'slightly' raise the temperature, without changing the 'degree of doneness' too much!
